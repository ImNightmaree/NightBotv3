# This is Night Bot v3, otherwise known as Ricky BerBOT.

Yes, I know this is an awful bot. It's not supposed to be used, it's just meant to be a learning experience. Feel free to observe the code if you'd like.

Please note that in order for the bot to start properly, it'll attempt to read from an .env file (or environment variables, either works). Please ensure you set the following values:

TOKEN: <this should be your bot token from https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/>

PREFIX: <what prefix do you want the bot to use?>

OWNER: <what's your Discord tag? Ideally include the full tag, i.e. Steve#0001>

OWNERID: <what's your ID? You can get this by enabling developer mode on Discord, right clicking your username and clicking "Copy ID">

BOTID: <what's the ID of the bot? You can get this from your bot's developer page where you created the token>

EMBEDCOLOR: <what's the hex code of the colour you'd like embeds to use? Make sure to include the #!>
